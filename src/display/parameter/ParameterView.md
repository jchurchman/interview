Given the list of parameters in `src/data/parameters.js`, create a component
or components that would display any of these parameters individually or any
combination of them as a list.

The output must meet the following criteria:
* `description` value in bold
* `id` as a link inline and to the right of the description that uses the `uri` as its href
* `parameterType` directly below `description`
* `status` directly below `parameterType`
* other values in any order you see fit
* all values displayed must be preceded by a *bold* label (e.g. "*label*: value")
* `ParameterView` component should have one default export

Similar to the first excercise, completion of the above tasks may be followed up by questions
about improving your design.
