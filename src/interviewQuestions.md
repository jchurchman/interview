## Interview Questions:
### Review most recent working situation:
-	What did you like most about this role, 
-	What did you like least?
-	Have you done any pair programming before, how did that go?

What do you like most about being a developer, what do you like least?

Give us an example of a time where you were blocked and how you overcame that to complete a task/goal/project.

## Review Previous Project:
Spend 5-10 minutes talking through an app that you’ve built or a code pattern that you’re particularly proud of.

### Experience with React/Redux:
-	What do you like most about this stack,
-	What do you like least
-	What would be an improvement? 
### Code questions:
-	Find React interview questions
-	Do some HTTP questions
-	How to maintain state between frontend and backend
-	Is REST a stateful paradigm?
-	You have a button and an input. It doesn’t matter what the button does, but when it is clicked, the input should become focused. What do you need to accomplish this?

## Hypothetical: 
You are given a specification document with one screenshot of an existing page within a complex application.

The task is to add a button to the page (indicated in the screenshot). When the user clicks the button, a fetch request is triggered that will return a list, which is to be displayed below the button, (also indicated in the screenshot). 

Given this information, how would you go about accomplishing this task?


## Prompt questions to aid in conversation:

Given only the information present, what questions would you ask? 

Assuming you are responsible for other tasks, how would you prioritize the development of this task among other tasks? 

What blockers do you foresee and how would you overcome them.

Verbally walk use through the development of this, make sure to speak to the redux cycle.
